#===============================================================================
# Whaatever functions, you need to calculated values, analysis, etc. 

# Loose code you put here will be called only ONCE when you do runApp(), unless 
# it is a function that gets called throughout the user intereaction. 

# This means that if you want values to persist across multiple sessions/page 
# refreshes, initialise the variables here globally eg: 
#     a <<- 45
# And assign new values in the session using the double arrows as well.

        # are updated.
